// Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree and a target integer value and returns the closest value to that target contained in the BST.
// You can assume that there will only be one closest value.
// Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satifies the
// BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node
//  to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves of None / null.
