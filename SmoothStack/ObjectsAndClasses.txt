Introduction to Classes and object
Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it uses a paradigm centered around objects and classes. Here's an explanation of these fundamental concepts:

Classes:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that its objects will have.

Think of a class as a cookie cutter, and objects as the cookies cut from that template.

In Python, classes are created using the class keyword.

Creating Classes:
When you create a class, you specify the attributes(data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.
Attributes are defined as variables within the class, and methods are defined as functions.
For example,you can design a "Car" class with attributes such as "color" and "speed," along with methods like "accelerate."

Objects:
An object is a fundamental unit in Python that represents a real-world entity or concept.
Objects can be tangible (like a car) or abstract (like a student's grade).

Every object has two main characteristics:

State:
The attributes or data that describe the object. For our "Car" object, this might include attributes like "color", "speed", and "fuel level".

Behavior:
The actions or methods that the object can perform. In Python, methods are functions that belong to objects and can change the object's state or perform specific operations.

Instantiating Objects:
Once you've defined a class, you can create individual objects (instances) based on that class.
Each object is independent and has its own set of attributes and methods.
To create an object, you use the class name followed by parentheses, so: "my_car = Car()"
Interacting with Objects:
You interact with objects by calling their methods or accessing their attributes using dot notation.

For example, if you have a Car object named my_car, you can set its color with my_car.color = "blue" and accelerate it with my_car.accelerate() if there's an accelerate method defined in the class.

Structure of classes and object code
Please don't directly copy and use this code as it's meant as a template for explanation and isn't tailored for specific results.

Class Declaration (class ClassName):
The class keyword is used to declare a class in Python.
ClassName is the name of the class, typically following CamelCase naming conventions.

Class Attributes (class_attribute = value):
Class attributes are variables that are shared among all instances (objects) of the class.
They are defined within the class but outside of any methods.

class ClassName:
    # Class attributes (shared by all instances)
    class_attribute = value

Constructor Method (def init(self, attribute1, attribute2, …):):
The __init__ method is a special method known as the constructor.
It initializes the instance attributes (also called instance variables) when an object is created.
The self parameter is the first parameter of the constructor, referring to the instance being created.
attribute1, attribute2, and so on are parameters passed to the constructor when creating an object.
Inside the constructor, self.attribute1, self.attribute2, and so on are used to assign values to instance attributes.

    # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2, ...):
        pass
        # ...
Copied!
Instance Attributes (self.attribute1 = attribute1):
Instance attributes are variables that store data specific to each instance of the class.
They are initialized within the init method using the self keyword followed by the attribute name.
These attributes hold unique data for each object created from the class.

        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2
        # ...
Copied!
Instance Methods (def method1(self, parameter1, parameter2, …):):
Instance methods are functions defined within the class.
They operate on the instance's data (instance attributes) and can perform actions specific to instances.
The self parameter is required in instance methods, allowing them to access instance attributes and call other methods within the class.

Note:- Now, we have successfully created a dummy class.

Creating Objects (Instances):
To create objects (instances) of the class, you call the class like a function and provide arguments required by the constructor.
Each object is a distinct instance of the class, with its own set of instance attributes and the ability to call methods defined in the class.

# Create objects (instances) of the class
object1 = ClassName(arg1, arg2, ...)
object2 = ClassName(arg1, arg2, ...)

Calling methods on objects:
In this section we will call methods on objects, specifically object1 and object2.
The methods method1 and method2 are defined in the ClassName class, and you're calling them on object1 and object2 respectively.
You pass values param1_value and param2_value as arguments to these methods. These arguments are used within the method's logic.
Method 1: Using dot notation:
This is the most straightforward way to call an object's method. In this we use the dot notation (object.method()) to directly invoke the method on the object.
For example, result1 = object1.method1(param1_value, param2_value, ...) calls method1 on object1.

# Calling methods on objects
# Method 1: Using dot notation
result1 = object1.method1(param1_value, param2_value, ...)
result2 = object2.method2(param1_value, param2_value, ...)
Copied!
Method 2: Assigning object methods to variables:
Here's an alternative way to call an object's method by assigning the method reference to a variable.
method_reference = object1.method1 assigns the method method1 of object1 to the variable method_reference.
Later, we call the method using the variable like this: result3 = method_reference(param1_value, param2_value, …).

# Method 2: Assigning object methods to variables
method_reference = object1.method1  # Assign the method to a variable
result3 = method_reference(param1_value, param2_value, ...)

Accessing object attributes:
Here, we are accessing an object's attribute using dot notation.
attribute_value = object1.attribute1 retrieves the value of the attribute attribute1 from object1 and assigns it to the variable attribute_value.

# Accessing object attributes
attribute_value = object1.attribute1  # Access the attribute using dot notation
Copied!
Modifying object attributes:
We are modifying an object's attribute using dot notation.
object1.attribute2 = new_value sets the attribute attribute2 of object1 to the new value new_value.
1
2
# Modifying object attributes
object1.attribute2 = new_value  # Change the value of an attribute using dot notation
Copied!
Accessing class attributes (shared by all instances):
Finally,we access a class attribute, which is shared by all instances of the class.
class_attr_value = ClassName.class_attribute accesses the class attribute class_attribute from the ClassName class and assigns its value to the variable
class_attr_value.

# Accessing class attributes (shared by all instances)
class_attr_value = ClassName.class_attribute

Real-world example
Let's write a python program that simulates a simple car class, allowing you to create car instances, accelerate them, and display their current speeds.

Let's start by defining a Car class that includes the following attributes and methods:
Class attribute max_speed, which is set to 120 km/h.

Constructor method __init__ that takes parameters for the car's make, model, color, and an optional speed (defaulting to 0). This method initializes instance attributes for make, model, color, and speed.

Method accelerate(self, acceleration) that allows the car to accelerate. If the acceleration does not exceed the max_speed, update the car's speed attribute. Otherwise, set the speed to the max_speed.

Method get_speed(self) that returns the current speed of the car.

class Car:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    max_speed = 120  # Maximum speed in km/h
    # Constructor method (initialize instance attributes)
    def __init__(self, make, model, color, speed=0):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.speed = speed  # Initial speed is set to 0
    # Method for accelerating the car
    def accelerate(self, acceleration):
        if self.speed + acceleration <= Car.max_speed:
            self.speed += acceleration
        else:
            self.speed = Car.max_speed
    # Method to get the current speed of the car
    def get_speed(self):
        return self.speed
Copied!
Now, we will instantiate two objects of the Car class, each with the following characteristics:
car1: Make = "Toyota", Model = "Camry", Color = "Blue"

car2: Make = "Honda", Model = "Civic", Color = "Red"

# Create objects (instances) of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Blue")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic", "Red")
Copied!
Using the accelerate method, we will increase the speed of car1 by 30 km/h and car2 by 20 km/h.

# Accelerate the cars
car1.accelerate(30)
car2.accelerate(20)

Lastly, we will display the current speed of each car by utilizing the `get_speed method.

# Print the current speeds of the cars
print(f"{car1.make} {car1.model} is currently at {car1.get_speed()} km/h.")
print(f"{car2.make} {car2.model} is currently at {car2.get_speed()} km/h.")

Next Steps
In conclusion, this reading provides a fundamental understanding of objects and classes in Python, essential concepts in object-oriented programming. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating both data attributes and methods. Objects represent real-world entities and possess their own unique state and behavior. The structured code example presented in the reading outlines the key elements of a class, including class attributes, the constructor method for initializing instance attributes, and instance methods for defining object-specific functionality.
